## Transformations
This folder includes the required transformation rotation matrices between all defined frames with regards to the AcubeSAT AOCS design. The defined frames are:

+ Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI)
+ Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF/ECF)
+ local North-East-Down (NED)
+ Orbit frame

#### Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) to Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) frame

#### Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) to local North-East-Down (NED) frame

#### Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI) to Orbit frame

#### angles to quaternion
This function converts euler angles to quaternion using ZYX rotation sequence
